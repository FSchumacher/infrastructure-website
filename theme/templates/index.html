        <h3>News from Infra</h3>
        <hr/>
          <p><b>January, 2022:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>The ASF is decommissioning the venerable FreeBSD host, minotaur.apache.org. The primary functions of this host have long since moved to <i>people.apache.org</i>, also known as <i>home.apache.org</i>. If you have a shell account on minotaur, make sure that you have retrieved your data prior to the decommissioning date of <b>January 31, 2022</b>.</li>
              <li> Infra has enabled 2FA (two-factor authentication support on oauth.apache.org (used for sites such as lists.apache.org and cveprocess.apache.org, etc). You can couple a Google Authenticator or other TOTP (Time-based One Time Password apps) to your login process for added security. To enable 2FA, click the <b>2FA</b> link next time you have to use oauth.apache.org for a login.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        <p><b>December, 2021:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>The ASF retired the services at <em>mail-archive.apache.org/</em> and <em>mail-private.apache.org/</em> on 31 December 2021. All link references now redirect to the corresponding <em>lists.apache.org/</em> location.</li>
            <li>Infra has subscribed all Project Management Committee (PMC) members to the "announce" mailing list, <i>announce AT infra.apache.org</i>. Messages to this list share changes to Infra services which may require action on the part of your Project, or which may impact the way users access ASF services. An example of this type of notification would be the changeover from http to https for our TLP webservers. Committers are welcome to subscribe to the list; PMC members <b>cannot</b> unsubscribe.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p><b>November, 2021: </b> If you have an ASF email inbox, please review <a href="https://infra.apache.org/spam-reporting.html" target="_blank">Dealing with spam in your ASF email account</a>. This policy addresses a problem that arises when people see possible spam forwarded from their ASF inbox to their personal email account, and report it as spam. </p>
      <p><b>October, 2021: </b> The ASF has long depended on a network of download mirrors to provide access to projects' product releases. We have now moved to a global content distribution network (CDN). The primary change projects and downloaders will experience is a much shorter delay between when a project posts a new release and when it is available world-wide for download. Read about <a href="https://apache.org/history/mirror-history.html" target="_blank">the history of the ASF download mirror system</a>.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p style="height: 60px; font-size: 0.9rem;">We periodically publish updates about Infra's work, successes, and challenges on <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/infra/" target="_blank">the Infra blog</a>.</p>
