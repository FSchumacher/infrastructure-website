== Terms
[%step]
* build-time
* flaky tests

[.notes]
In this talk build-time refers to the time a build spends occupying build resources.
1 build day is 24 hours of non-stop work for a worker node. whether it's 1 24 hour
build or 24 1 hour builds doesn't matter. it's 24 hours of build-time.

Flaky tests are tests that _may_ pass on a second (or third) run.

== Caching and the Need for speed.

[.notes]
Local and Remote build caching enables savings of an average of over 13 minutes per build.
or 90-100 build-days per calendar week.

== De-Mystifying Flaky tests

== Better resource utilization.
