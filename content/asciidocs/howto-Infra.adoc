== A Day in the Life of Infra
* Jira tickets
* Project work
* Monitoring Slack chat (#asfinfra) and email

== Infra On-Call
* Whoop whoop something’s busted
* 24/7 for a week, rotation, etc
* What we monitor and why.

== Infra and ASF Policies
* Infra handles operational policy
   - Traffic on our services (things like bans)
* The Foundation handles legal policy
   - Members help shape policy that Infra enforces. Things like how releases are handled, how voting happens, etc.

== Being a bad guy, doesn't mean you're a "bad guy"
* We’re kind and loving systems administrators.
* We enforce the policy created by members, committers, the board, us, gnomes, dogs, cats, etc.
* How can we improve? 

== Effectively using Infra
* How to change policy
* How to introduce a new $thing
* How to face rejection when we tell you no
