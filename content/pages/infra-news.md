**September 16, 2024**: For clarity, Infra has updated the statement on release artifact sizes which appears on the [Release Distribution Policy](release-distribution.html) page. The statement now reads: "Infra recommends keeping the size of your release artifacts below 100MB. The ASF will **not** host release artifacts larger than 1GB."

**September 14, 2024**: Infra has ended the `home.apache.org` hosting service for committer websites and content. More details are <a href="https://infra.apache.org/blog/end_of_home.html">here</a>.
          
**August 30, 2024**: In the ASF Slack workspace (`the-asf.slack.com`), channels with Qbot installed now also have access to 'Lauren', a member of the Human Resources department of an alternate-world ASF, in which the Foundation has a big office where Committers and Members work. Lauren can provide policy statements, review complaints, point out employee benefits, and make important (to Lauren) announcements. Lauren is very sure her information is accurate and up-to-date; you may have a different opinion. Instructions for contacting Lauren are on the [Qbot page](qbot.html).

**July 16, 2024**: [Qbot](qbot.html) is a tool to make a number of tasks easier in a project's channel in the `the-asf` Slack workspace.

**June 20, 2024**: Infra has added `apache.org` to Chrome's HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) preload list, improving security measures for the majority of visitors to our sites. This change went into effect on July 1st.

**May 10, 2024**: Since there is a wide range of similar tools people can use, Apache Paste, a tool for sharing code snippets and similar material, is no longer available.

**April 12, 2024**: the <a href="https://infra-reports.apache.org/" target="_blank">ASF Infrastructure Reporting Dashboard</a> provides a collection of reports on the overall health and activity of the infrastructure at the ASF. These reports can be helpful in understanding the status of all the ASF 'under the hood' resources, and in assessing the resource cost of some activities, like build processes.
