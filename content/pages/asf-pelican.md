Title: ASF-Pelican

When the ASF content management system, which projects used from 2010, reached end of life, Infra provided several options to which PMCs could move their project websites.

In 2021 Infra created ASF-Pelican as a structure and template for projects still on the CMS and for the ASF's own website. The template is available at <a href="https://github.com/apache/template-site" target="_blank">github.com/apache/template-site</a>.

Review the following information to simplify your work with, and get your best results from, the template:
