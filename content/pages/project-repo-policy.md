Title: Project Code Repository Policy

Apache projects can have Subversion or Git code repositories for their product code and assets. The majority of projects now use Git.

  - Projects can have as many repositories as their work requires.
  - Projects can request new, blank Git repositories through <a href="https://selfserve.apache.org" target="_blank">selfserve</a>.
  - Each project can also request (using a Jira ticket) that Infra set up **one** private repository for use with tasks, such as fixing security issues in project code, that should not be publically available.
  - Review the [Repository Access Policy](repository-access.html).
