Title: Project sites using MKDocs

<a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/" target="_blank">MKDocs</a> is a static site generator designed for creating project documentation. However, at least one ASF project uses it to build their entire project website.

Normally the command `mkdocs gh-deploy` will remove site, rebuild it, and then deploy the contents to the given remote branch
