Title: Apache and GitHub

The ASF has a <a href="https://github.com/apache" target="_blank">presence on GitHub</a>.

**Can I write to repositories at GitHub**?

If your project is currently hosted on Gitbox then you can push to GitHub.
In order to get write access to repositories, you will need to visit our <a href="https://gitbox.apache.org/boxer/">Boxer</a> 
portal, which will guide you through the process of linking your ASF and GitHub accounts. The process only takes 
a minute or two, and will automatically grant you access to all the repositories owned by the projects 
you are active on.

**To move to GitHub as master follow the steps below:**

1. Add yourself to our GitHub organization (see above) and make sure you are already a committer for the relevant project.
1. Visit the <a href="https://gitbox.apache.org/" target="_blank">GitBox site</a> and link your GitHub account with your ASF account.
1. Wait about an hour for things to sync up.
1. You now have read/write access to both gitbox.apache.org and GitHub!

**Assign roles**

Projects can [assign roles](github-roles.html) to people who want access to the project GitHub repositories. Each role gives a different level of access.
