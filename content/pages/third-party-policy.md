Title: Policy on issues in third-party services
license: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

The ASF pays for certain services, such as one that provides storage/search/access for our mailing list archives. In some cases, the third-party service uses a version of a package we are familiar with; but that does not mean that what they provide is identical to the package we know.

A divergence between what the provider offers and what we are familiar with does not necessarily constitute a bug, and Infra cannot change code in a third party's product so its behavior matches what we are used to.

If your experience of a third-party service The ASF uses is unsatisfactory, open a Jira ticket for Infra and describe the issue. We will review such tickets and determine how to redirect or otherwise process them.
