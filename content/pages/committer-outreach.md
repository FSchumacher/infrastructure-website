Title: Policy for Outreach to Committers

# Outreach
There are many situations where the Foundation, or groups within,
want to reach out to the many Committers who volunteer their time
to our many efforts.

This policy covers all
channels for reaching the Foundation's committers.


# Coverage

  - For general communications, it is easiest to reach Committers via the `committers@`
mailing list
  - All members of all PMCs (which includes many, but not all, Committers) must be subscribed to the 'announce@infra` mailing list, and that is where to send important announcements related to infrastructure events such as outages, new services, and services being retired.
  - On occasion it makes more sense to send emails directly to the affected Committers.
  - Several Slack channels, such as 'asfinfra` and `announcements`, are useful for sending a version of the current email message. The Slack message may catch some people who have not yet checked their email.
