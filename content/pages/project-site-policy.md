Title: Project website policy

Every Apache Top Level Project (TLP) is to have a static website that conforms withe the <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs#navigation" target="_blank">Apache Project Website Branding Policy</a>. The <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/site/" target="_blank">Apache Project Website Checks</a> tool reviews TLP websites to evaluate how well they comply with the policy.

From Infra's point of view:

- The project website must be hosted on ASF-operated hardware
- The project website source code must be stored in an ASF Git or Subversion repository
