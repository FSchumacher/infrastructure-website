Title: Project site policy

Every Apache top level project (TLP) must have a static website that conforms with the <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs#navigation" target="_blank">Apache Project Site Branding Policy</a>.

Whimsy's <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/site/" target="_blank">Apache Project Website Checks</a> tool periodically reviews all TLP websites to provide a report on how well they comply with that policy, and to identify issues that a project may need to address.

From Infra's point of view:

1. Each TLP's website must be hosted on ASF-operated hardware.
2. The website's source code must be stored in an ASF Git or Subversion repository.
