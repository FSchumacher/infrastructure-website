Spam Reporting Policy [DRAFT]

The ASF acts as a forwarding service for @apache.org committer email addresses, passing email delivered to your @apache.org address along to your personal designated account. Due to this process, mail received to your personal account via your @apache.org email address has a header origination of the ASF's mail servers.

Marking such email as Spam using tools like Outlook's "Report as Junk" feature causes the Foundation's mail servers to be flagged as spammers. This ultimately results in the Foundation's mail servers being banned from mailing to services like Outlook/O365 and other major email services.

Infra requests that you do not flag any mail sent to your @apache.org as spam, simply delete it instead. If there is a particularly persistent spam issue, please report it via Infra Jira ticket, or via email to root@apache.org.

Per above, Infra is seeing ongoing issues of legitimate project/mailing list ema
il being flagged as spam. Due to the negative email reputation this causes, Infr
a is taking a zero tolerance policy with subscribers who flag legitimate list em
ail as spam. Upon receipt of such a report, Infra will unsubscribe the reporting
 address from all ASF email lists
