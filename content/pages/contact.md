Title: Contact the Infrastructure Team

### Chat
Join us on [Slack](https://the-asf.slack.com/) in the #asfinfra channel for direct messaging!

### Request resources/tasks/projects
Please create a [Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/) ticket for your request. 

Review the [guidelines for creating a Jira ticket](jira-guidelines).


### For general inquiries
General inquiries and questions should go to: `users@infra.apache.org`.

To subscribe to that list, send an email, from the email address you want to use, to `users-subscribe@infra.apache.org`.

### What we need to know ###

Here's a [guide to what to tell us](infra-contact.html) so we can respond to your request quickly and appropriately.

### In case of emergency ###

If there is an absolutely urgent problem that must be handled **at once**, such as a malicious hacker having an active root through shell on `archive.apache.org`, follow this escalation path:
  1. Send an email to `root@` and `private@infra` describing the issue. If you get no response within fifteen minutes...
  2. Create a message on the `#asfinfra channel in the Slack Apache space (link is at the top of the page). If you get no response within ten minutes...
  3. Open a Jira ticket (link is higher in the page) for INFRA, with a priority of **blocker**.
