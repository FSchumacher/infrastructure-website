### Request a change to the main ASF website
The Marketing and Publicity (M&P) committee is responsible for the main ASF website. The source for the website is at <a href="https://github.com/apache/www-site" target="_blank">github.com/apache/www-site</a>. You can create an Issue there to state what you think should change, and what you propose the change to be.

### You think your IP address has been blocked
If you cannot access one or more ASF repositories or services, your IP address may have been blocked. Before contacting Infra, review <a href="https://infra.apache.org/abc/" targeet="_blank">Abuse and Connectivity Issues at the ASF</a> (ABC). The page lists the common overuse (or abuse) issues that affect our site's work and cause an automatic IP address block, and recommends steps to get such a block removed. ABC also provides a channel to contact Infra if you need more information than the page provides.

### What we need to know ###

Here's a [guide to what to tell us](infra-contact.html) so we can respond to your request quickly and appropriately.

### In case of emergency ###

If there is an absolutely urgent problem that must be handled **at once**, such as a malicious hacker having an active root through shell on `archive.apache.org`, follow this escalation path:
  1. Send an email to `root@` and `private@infra` describing the issue. If you get no response within fifteen minutes...
  2. Create a message on the `#asfinfra` channel in the Slack Apache space (link is at the top of the page). If you get no response within ten minutes...
  3. Open a Jira ticket (link is higher in the page) for INFRA, with a priority of **blocker**.
