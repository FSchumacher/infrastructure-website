Title: The Infra Roundtable

To provide a space for conversations on issues related to the ASF's infrastructure, Infra holds a monthly roundtable of free-flowing discussion, with the first meeting set for early December, 2022.

  - The roundtable takes place on the first Wednesday of each month for an hour, starting at 15:30 UTC, in a huddle on Slack's `#roundtable` channel in the ASF workspace.
  - Infra will post the general topic for each month's meeting.
  - The roundtables are available to anyone who can access the ASF workspace on Slack: basically, committers and Members.

### To join the roundtable

In The ASF workspace on Slack, enter this command:

`/qbot addme roundtable`

(qbot is an Infra tool to simplify actions within the ASF Slack workspace.)

When you are in the channel, you can share messages with others as a sort of pre-meeting. At some point an infra staffer will post a message inviting people to join the channel **huddle**. Te link to join the huddle looks like a white dot beside the outline of a headset. Click the link to join the huddle.

### What happens in the roundtable

  - An Infra team member will normally open the meeting with a short presentation related to the advertised topic, and then throw the floor open to discussion. 
  - Please mute your microphone when not speaking, to cut down on ambient noise.
  - If you want to speak, just unmute and start speaking. We will all try to practice good meeting manners, which include not talking over others.
  - When you are done with what you want to ask or say, remember to mute yourself again.

#### Questions
Each roundtable has a unique question queue which lives in a thread. The queue is interactive to reduce channel chatter during the meeting. The meeting addresses questions according to the number of **upvotes** they receive: if question 1 has one upvote and question 2 has six, we will address question 2 before question 1.
  - To see the thread, click the **show thread** icon (it looks like a speech balloon). 
  - The question queue appears in a new window within the huddle.
  - To **ask a question**, click the `Ask a Question` button and write out your question. You will be able to explain your question when we get to it, so you can keep the question short.
  - To **upvote a question**, click its `upvote` button. **Note**: you can't remove an upvote once you have voted, so only upvote the questions you really are interested in, rather than, say, upvoting everything.

### To leave the roundtable

When you want to leave, click the huddle button to leave the huddle. Then move to any other ASF channel of your choice.

### After the roundtable

Infra posts a summary of each roundtable's discussion on a page in the Infra CWiki space. Check back soon to find a link to those summaries here.
