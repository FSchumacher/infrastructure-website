Title: Content Moderation Policies

This page lists the most common questions and answers surrounding content moderation 
policies at ASF Infrastructure, including, but not limited to:

- Data Privacy (GDPR, CCPA, CPPA/PIPEDA, etc)
- Accidental exposure of credentials or other sensitive data
- Spam removal


## Personal Data Privacy Requests
Request regarding exposure of PII (Personal Identifiable Information) **MUST** be sent to our 
Data Privacy Officer at `privacy@apache.org`. For more information on personal data privacy, 
please see https://privacy.apache.org/

## Accidental exposure of credentials or company-sensitive data

**TL;DR:** If your company experiences accidental exposure of sensitive data or credentials, 
you should always assume that the data is now public, and immediately invalidate these credentials.


Depending on the context and circumstance of your request, we _may_ be able to remove the 
following items:

- Specific emails from our mailing list archives*
- Public comments on PRs/issues*
- Web pages or packages with compromised data

`*`Removing emails from public archives is not likely to be approved, as the propagation makes it 
   virtually impossible to enact.

We are **not** able to, and will not spend time with the following:

- Deleting PRs from GitHub (cannot be done)
- Deleting LDAP or other governance records that pertain to existing committers
