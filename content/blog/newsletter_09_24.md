Welcome to *Inside Infra* for September, 2024

### A staffing change

Chis Thistlethwaite, who has been an important part of the Infrastructure team for almost nine years, is moving on to another project. His last day of work at The ASF is October 11, 2024.

Chris will be at Community over Code in Denver, Colorado, USA, October 7-10, so be sure to wish him good luck in his new work if you run into him there. He will continue to be active as a Member of the ASF. (Note for the record books: Chris's first week of work in 2016 involved attending ApacheCon EU in Seville, Spain.)

Here is a link to an <a href="https://news.apache.org/foundation/entry/inside-infra-chris-thistlethwaite-part" target="_blank">interview with Chris</a>.


### Qbot qnews

**1. Jira features**

In the ASF Slack workspace (the-asf.slack.com), ASF Members using channels with Qbot installed can now call up Jira tickets that match various search conditions (unassigned, related to a certain project, and so on). Details on the available commands are on the <a href="https://infra.apache.org/qbot.html" target="_blank">Qbot page</a>.


**2. Lauren marches on**

Slack channels with Qbot installed now also have access to 'Lauren', a member of the Human Resources department of an alternate-world ASF, in which the Foundation has a big office where Committers and Members work. Lauren can provide policy statements, review complaints, point out employee benefits, and make important (to Lauren) announcements. Lauren is very sure her information is accurate and up-to-date; you may have a different opinion. Instructions for contacting Lauren are also on the Qbot page.


### Working with lists.apache.org

<a href="https://lists.apache.org/" target="_blank">lists.apache.org</a> lets you search, browse and contribute to the ASF email lists to which you have access, but it is not obvious that, for instance, you can use lists.a.o to create an email in a list to which you have subscribed.

The page [Working in lists.apache.org](email_lists.html) explains what your access is and what options are available, and provides a list of hotkeys you can use to do what you need to do.


### Release artifact recommended and maximum sizes

For clarity, Infra has updated the statement in the [Release Distribution Policy](release-distribution.html) on release artifact sizes. The statement now reads: **Infra recommends keeping the size of your release artifacts below 100MB. The ASF will not host release artifacts larger than 1GB.**


### Roundtable summary

The September 4, 2024 Roundtable had a focus on what barriers or challenges projects whose members are primarily in Asia or Australia meet in ASF infrastructure. A summary of the conversation is on the CWiki: <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Infra+Roundtable+2024-09-03%2C+00%3A00+UTC" target="_blank">Infra Roundtable 2024-09-03, 00:00 UTC</a>.

The next Roundtable will be in person at the Community over Code event in Denver, Colorado, USA: **October 8, 2:50 pm local time, Mt. Harvard Room**. We will not be recording the roundtable, but will publish a summary of the conversation.

More soon!
