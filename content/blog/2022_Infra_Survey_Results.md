### Intro
I'd like to thank everyone that took time to take the survey. This is the first time that I know of that we've tried something like this and feedback is very important. I'd also like to take a second to clarify my tone for this article. During the writing of this I'm presenting as Chris T. the Infra person, not a ASF Member or committer. So when I say "we" or "us", I'm referring to the other Infra folks, not specifically the Foundation as a whole or any members. The results will also not be posted in full but a summary of the data as we had some responses that used enough information to identify the person being discussed. Those responses are 100% valid and I don't want to post an incomplete dataset with them removed. 

### Summary of Results
The survey was sent to 4109 (plus anyone that went to the blog post) people and we recieved 80 responses. While that isn't a huge percentage of results, it's is a very managable dataset to parse through. I also presume that some people submitting responses were conveying information gathered from a project. There weren't many surprises in responses as we all know a lot of the pain points. However it's vital for us as Infra to have data in order to back up work and projects we're working on. 

Here are the top subjects that were referred to repeatedly:

    1. Public Jira access is a problem
    2. Communication is a problem
        1. Open/Public Slack
        2. General Infra communications
    3. CI/CD is a problem
        1. Capacity/Speed
        2. Platforms (Jenkins, Buildbot, GHA, etc)
    4. Release process is a problem


The charts reflect the data above:

### Next Steps
Well the easy thing to say would be “fix all the things”! To be honest, there is on-going work with all the above issues, and most of them aren’t something I can answer in a short post. Now that we have data and a baseline, we’ll evaluate and discuss how we’re going to address your concerns. Being that I’ve never done one of these surveys before, the next steps aren’t laid out, so we’ll have to take them together.
