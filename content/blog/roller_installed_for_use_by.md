**Note**: Until June, 2023, the ASF supported using Apache Roller for project blogs. That support has ended. Please visit <a href="https://infra.apache.org/project-blogs.html" target="_blank">Project Blog</a> for more information about blogs for projects.
<hr/>


Roller was installed today for the use of ASF Projects. Those committers with personal blogs should instead add their feed to planet.apache.org.

Still a few things to sort out, but blogs.apache.org is mostly ready.

Any project that wants a blog, please can a PMC member email infra or create a jira issue.

Thanks and Enjoy!
