**Welcome to *Inside Infra* for November, 2024**

## Two November Roundtables

Infra held two Roundtables this month. The November 6 meeting was at 1700 UTC (more convenient for folks in Europe and North America) and the meeting on the 13th was at 1000 UTC in hopes that ASF folks in Asia and Australia would be able to attend.

The topic at both meetings was **Phishing attempts, spam, and code security**. Drew Folks led a presentation on maintaining information confidentiality, availability, and integrity. At both meetings the conversation was wide-ranging, with speculation and ideas about how to achieve those goals better at the ASF.

Summaries of the conversations are here:

## December roundtable

The next roundtable will be **Wednesday, December 4, 1700 UTC**. The main topic will be a deep dive into **asf.yaml**, the Swiss Army Knife of ASF build utilities.
