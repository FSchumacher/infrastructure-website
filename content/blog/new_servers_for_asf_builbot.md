<p>The ASF Buildbot CI instance has just launched two more secondary servers, expanding the range of platforms it can build and test on.</p>
  <p>Added are servers on the FreeBSD 8 platform (a VM on the Nyx VMware host)&nbsp;and a Solaris Zone.</p>
  <p>Projects are welcome to create an Infra issue or email the <a href="mailto:builds@apache.org">builds@apache.org</a> list asking for your project to begin CI testing on those and/or the existing Ubuntu and Windows secondary servers.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
