25 years ago, it was somewhat difficult for people to put personal content onto the web, so the ASF provided that feature for our committers. It was first known as `people.apache.org` and later as `home.apache.org`. Many ASF committers have made use of the service, and it currently holds several hundred gigabytes of data.

Today, there are so many options to host content that it no longer makes sense for the Foundation to perform that function, and we will be turning "home" off around Thursday, **September 12, 2024**. We ask that anyone with content on the service to log in via `sftp` and download the data they want to preserve.

We also note that members of some projects have been using `home` as a way to share release candidates of project code. This was never the purpose of the `home` service. Please use one of the approved locations for sharing release candidates:  `dist.apache.org/dev/` or `nightlies.apache.org`.
